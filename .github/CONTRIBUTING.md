The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the commercetools <-> Talon.One Connector.

## Code of Conduct

We have adopted a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/talon-one/commercetools-talonone-connector/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read the full text so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated as part of your activity in this community.

## Development

All work on commercetools <-> Talon.One Connector happens directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/talon-one/commercetools-talonone-connector). Both core team members and external contributors send pull requests which go through the same process (review, testing, acceptance, etc.).

## Bugs

We are using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/talon-one/commercetools-talonone-connector/issues) for bug tracking.
Please follow our templates when reporting a bug, providing as many details as possible to help us and other contributors respond the best we can.

Before you report a bug or ask for a feature request, please make sure you've searched existing issues to minimize duplicates.

## Your First Pull Request

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://kcd.im/pull-request).

To help you get your feet wet and get you familiar with our contribution process, we try to maintain a list of [good first issues](https://github.com/talon-one/commercetools-talonone-connector/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%3Aone%3A++good+first+issue%22) that contain bugs or small features that have a relatively limited scope. This is a great place to get started.

If you decide to fix an issue, please be sure to check the comment thread in case somebody is already working on a fix. If nobody is working on it at the moment, please leave a comment stating that you intend to work on it so other people don't accidentally duplicate your effort.

If somebody claims an issue but doesn't follow up for more than two weeks, it's fine to take over it but you should still leave a comment.

## Sending a Pull Request

The core team is monitoring for pull requests. We will review your pull request and either merge it, request changes to it, or close it with an explanation.

If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests as part of your pull request.
